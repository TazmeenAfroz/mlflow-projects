# MLflow Projects

This repository contains multiple projects demonstrating how to use **MLflow** for experiment tracking and model management. It serves as a structured space for experimenting with MLflow concepts and best practices.

## 📌 Overview

[MLflow](https://mlflow.org/) is an open-source platform designed to manage the machine learning lifecycle, including:
- **Experiment Tracking**: Log and compare runs (parameters, metrics, and artifacts).
- **Model Registry**: Organize, version, and manage models.
- **Reproducibility**: Ensure consistent results with environments and packaging.

This repository acts as an umbrella for different MLflow projects:
- ✅ **Getting Started with MLflow (Iris Dataset)** – See `getting_started.ipynb`
- ✅ **House Price Prediction with MLflow** – [View Submodule](https://github.com/TazmeenAfroz/house-price-mlflow)
- - ✅ **Life Expectancy Prediction with MLflow** – [View Submodule](https://github.com/TazmeenAfroz/Life-Expectancy-Prediction-With-MLflow)
