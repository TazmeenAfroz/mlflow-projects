# MLflow Projects

This repository contains multiple projects demonstrating how to use **MLflow** for experiment tracking and model management. It serves as a structured space for experimenting with MLflow concepts and best practices.

## üìå Overview

[MLflow](https://mlflow.org/) is an open-source platform designed to manage the machine learning lifecycle, including:
- **Experiment Tracking**: Log and compare runs (parameters, metrics, and artifacts).
- **Model Registry**: Organize, version, and manage models.
- **Reproducibility**: Ensure consistent results with environments and packaging.

This repository acts as an umbrella for different MLflow projects:
- ‚úÖ **Getting Started with MLflow (Iris Dataset)** ‚Äì See `getting_started.ipynb`
- ‚úÖ **House Price Prediction with MLflow** ‚Äì [View Submodule](https://github.com/TazmeenAfroz/house-price-mlflow)
- ‚è≥ More projects will be added soon.
